		<p>With the Shopify Buy Button plugin you'll be able to embed your  Shopify products/collections on any WordPress site. This allows your customers to purchase your Shopify products directly from your site. How it works, is that the plugin will generate a shortcode that will allow you to display Shopify products via WordPress text editor or sidebar Text widget. </p>
		<h3>How to Use The Plugin:</h3>
		<p><strong>1. Add a Page/Post</strong></p>
		<p>To start, add a new post or page where you want to display the Shopify products. Above the WordPress editor, you will see an &quot;Add Product&quot; button with the Shopify icon that appears beside the &quot;Add Media&quot; button. Click on the &quot;Add Product&quot; button. </p>
		<p class="image border"><img alt="How to add a Shopify Product on a page/post" src="<?php echo plugin_dir_url( $this->path ) . '/admin/img/'; ?>add-product-1.png" /></p>
		<p><strong>2. Enter Your Shopify Store Name</strong></p>
		<p>After clicking on the &quot;Add Product&quot; button, you'll be prompted to input your Shopify Store name account. Enter your account name here to connect your Shopify store. </p>
		<p class="image border"><img alt="sync your Shopify store with WordPress" src="<?php echo plugin_dir_url( $this->path ) . '/admin/img/'; ?>login-shopify.png" /></p>
		<p><strong>3. Login Your Shopify Account</strong></p>
		<p>Entering your store name will open a new browser tab to the Shopify login form. Enter your email and password to login. </p>

		<p><strong>4. Select Products/Collections</strong></p>
		<p>After entering your email and password, you'll be redirected back to your WordPress site. From there you can select the products/collection which you want to embed. </p>
		<p class="image border"><img alt="selecting your products or collections" src="<?php echo plugin_dir_url( $this->path ) . '/admin/img/'; ?>select-product.png" /></p>
		<p><strong>5. Buy Button Appearance (Optional)</strong></p>
		<p>Once you finish selecting a product/collection, you'll proceed to the buy button styling panel. Here you'll be able to set the parameter of how you want the product showcased. You can also leave this section blank, doing so will use the default appearance which you can set in the Appearance option page. If you are OK with the default appearance options, click &quot;Insert Shortcode&quot; to generate the shortcode. Now you can copy &amp; paste this shortcode to any post, page, or Text widget in your sidebar.<br />
